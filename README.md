# College Event Registration and Attendance Management System

This project is a desktop and web application for managing event registrations and attendance, built with Python and an Oracle database. It provides a graphical user interface using Tkinter and a web interface using Flask.

## 🔹 Features

*   **Event Management**: Admins can create and manage events, including setting capacity limits.
*   **Student Registration**: Admins can register students for events, with automatic capacity enforcement.
*   **Attendance Marking**: Admins and volunteers can mark student attendance, but only on or after the event date.
*   **Email Notifications**: Admins can send customized email notifications to all registered attendees of an event. Emails are sent asynchronously to prevent UI blocking.
*   **Secure Password Storage**: User passwords are securely hashed using `bcrypt`.
*   **Role-Based Access**:
    *   **Admin**: Full access to create events, register students, mark attendance, view reports, and send email notifications.
    *   **Volunteer**: Limited access to mark attendance and view reports.
*   **Reporting**: View real-time attendance statistics for any event.
*   **CSV Export**: Export event attendance lists to a CSV file.
*   **Dual Interface**: The application can be run as a desktop application (using Tkinter) or as a web application (using Flask).

## 🔹 Tech Stack

*   **Backend**: Python 3
*   **Database**: Oracle
*   **UI**: 
    *   Desktop: Tkinter (built-in Python GUI library)
    *   Web: Flask
*   **Database Driver**: `python-oracledb`
*   **Password Hashing**: `bcrypt`

## 🔹 Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

1.  **Python 3**: Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2.  **Oracle Database**: You need access to an Oracle Database instance.
3.  **Oracle Instant Client**: The `python-oracledb` driver may require the Oracle Instant Client libraries. Follow the driver's installation instructions for your OS.

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository or download the source code.**

2.  **Install the required Python libraries:**
    The main dependencies are the Oracle database driver, the `bcrypt` library for password hashing, and `Flask` for the web interface.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure the Application:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
    *   Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file with your credentials:
        ```
        DB_USER=your_username
        DB_PASSWORD=your_password
        DB_DSN=your_host:your_port/your_service_name
        SMTP_SERVER=your.smtp.server.com
        SMTP_PORT=587
        SMTP_USERNAME=your_email@example.com
        SMTP_PASSWORD=your_email_password
        SENDER_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
        ```

4.  **Set up the Database Schema:**
    *   Connect to your Oracle database using a SQL client (like SQL*Plus or DBeaver).
    *   Run the script `event_system/database_setup.sql` to create all the required tables, sequences, and constraints.

5.  **Insert Sample Data (Optional):**
    *   To test the application with some pre-populated data, run the `event_system/sample_data.sql` script in your SQL client.
    *   This script will create sample users with hashed passwords, students, and an event.

## 🔹 How to Run the Application

You can run the application either as a desktop application or as a web application.

### Running the Desktop Application

Navigate to the parent directory (the one containing the `event_system` folder) and run the application as a Python module.

```bash
python -m event_system
```

The application window should appear, starting with the login screen.

### Running the Web Application

Navigate to the `event_system` directory and run the `web_ui.py` script.

```bash
python event_system/web_ui.py
```

The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your web browser.

### Creating a New User

You can create new users (admin or volunteer) with a securely hashed password by running the `create_user.py` script:

```bash
python -m event_system.create_user
```

You will be prompted to enter a username, password, and role.

### Sample Credentials

If you used the `sample_data.sql` script, you can log in with the following credentials:

*   **Admin User:**
    *   Username: `admin1`
    *   Password: `admin123`
*   **Volunteer User:**
    *   Username: `volunteer1`
    *   Password: `volunteer123`
